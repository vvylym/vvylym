---

15+ years building backend systems and leading engineering teams, worrking across real-estate investment, healthcare, and financial services - from building teams from scratch to shipping production systems.

Right now I'm deep into Rust, building microservices and mastering the ins and outs of async, concurrent and distributed programming. Always exploring new things, whether that's AI/ML applications or the latest patterns in software development.

## Background

I've led teams of 10+ engineers and mentored developers at all levels. Built distributed systems, data pipelines, and scaled backend infrastructure across different industries.

Always learning. My background mixes IT engineering and management, and I regularly take courses to sharpen my skills.

## What I'm Working/Worked On

**[FlowRaft](https://github.com/vvylym/flow-raft)**
A stateful, graph-based workflow engine written in Rust, designed to execute complex workflows in distributed environments.

**[Lemonade](https://github.com/vvylym/lemonade-tokio)**
An experimental implementation of high performance load balancer using an adaptive algorithm, leveraging Tokio-only for the load balancer, Axum and Actix Web for workers.

**[SpecKit](https://github.com/vvylym/spec-kit-rs)**
A pure Rust implementation of the GitHub's "specify" CLI focus on Specification Driven Development (SDD), aiming to provide the features in a rust binary with fewer dependencies.

**[Product Requirements Document Assistant](https://github.com/vvylym/prd-assistant)**
A CLI tool for generating and refining PRDs using local LLMs. Learning how to make LLMs useful for day-to-day engineering work.

**[Authentication Service with 2FA](https://github.com/vvylym/live-bootcamp-project)**
Production-ready auth service with 2FA in Rust (axum/tokio/serde/askama). Full CI/CD setup with Docker and GitHub Actions.
