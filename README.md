---

15+ years building backend systems and leading engineering teams. I've worked across real-estate investment, healthcare, and financial services - from building teams from scratch to shipping production systems.

Right now I'm deep into Rust, building microservices and learning the ins and outs of async systems. Always exploring new things, whether that's AI/ML applications or the latest patterns in distributed systems.

## Background

I've led teams of 10+ engineers (from interns to seniors) and mentored developers at all levels. Built distributed systems, data pipelines, and scaled backend infrastructure across different industries.

Always learning. My background mixes IT engineering and management, and I regularly take courses to sharpen my skills.

## What I'm Working On

**[FlowRaft](https://github.com/vvylym/)** (
Building a graph-based workflow engine in Rust. Using tokio/rayon to run complex stateful workflows across distributed systems with Raft consensus.

**[Product Requirements Document Assistant](https://github.com/vvylym/prd-assistant)**  
A CLI tool for generating and refining PRDs using local LLMs. Learning how to make LLMs useful for day-to-day engineering work.

**[Authentication Service with 2FA](https://github.com/vvylym/live-bootcamp-project)**  
Production-ready auth service with 2FA in Rust (axum/tokio/serde/askama). Full CI/CD setup with Docker and GitHub Actions.

## Get in Touch

Open to interesting opportunities in backend development, distributed systems, AI/ML, or technical leadership roles.
